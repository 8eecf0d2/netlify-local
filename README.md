Local Netlify service emulation.

**Experimental:** This package has not been heavily tested or used, some of the Netlify Services might be incorrectly implemented. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/8eecf0d2/netlify-local/issues) if you find any!

**Semver Notice:** Breaking changes which increase compatibility with Netlify Services are not considered breaking ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

For help bundling your Javascript to work with Netlify Functions, checkout [8eecf0d2/webpack-netlify-lambda-plugin](https://github.com/8eecf0d2/webpack-netlify-lambda-plugin) or [netlify/netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda).

An example Netlify deployable application is available at [8eecf0d2/netlify-local-example](https://github.com/8eecf0d2/netlify-local-example).

### Install

You should probably install as a dev dependency, but globally works too.
```bash
yarn add -D netlify-local
```

### Features

#### Static Router
The **static router** refers to the [Netlify Continuous Deployment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment) feature which serves files from the `build.publish` directory, specified within the toml configuration.

#### Lambda Router
The **lambda router** refers to the [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/features/functions) feature which serves Lambda's or Cloud Functions from the `build.functions` directory, specified within the toml configuration.

### Commands

#### `serve`

By default **netlify-local** will _try_ and start the **static router** and the **lambda router**.

```bash
netlify-local serve
```

##### `-s --static, -l --lambda`
You can prevent the **static router** or **lambda router** from being initialized by passing in the `-s --static` or `-l --lambda` with the value `false`.

```bash
netlify-local serve -s false -l false
```

##### `-n --netlify`

If your `netlify.toml` is not in the current directory you can pass in the `-n --netlify` argument with a relative path to the configuration file.

```bash
netlify-local serve -n app-functions/netlify.toml
```

##### `-w --webpack`

Optionally, **netlify-local** can run a Webpack watcher and rebuild your source files as you develop without the need to start and stop the web server. To use this feature pass in the `-w --webpack` argument with a relative path to your config.

```bash
netlify-local serve -w webpack.config.js
```

##### `-p --port`

Optionally, you can pick which port the server should bind on by passing in the `-p --port` argument with a number.

```bash
netlify-local serve -p 3000
```

### API

Specific classes and methods are exposed for running **netlify-local** programmatically, see [Issue #6](https://github.com/8eecf0d2/netlify-local/issues/6) for more information and documentation.

### Typings

Relevant Typescript typings are exposed for the API and also Netlify Function handlers.
```ts
import { Netlify } from "netlify-local";

export const handler: Netlify.Handler<handler.Request, handler.Context, handler.Response> = (request, context, callback) => {

  return callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "foo"
  })
}

export namespace handler {
  export interface Request extends Netlify.Handler.Request {
    headers: {
      example: string;
    }
  }
  export interface Context extends Netlify.Handler.Context {
    user: { ... }
  }
  export interface Response extends Netlify.Handler.Response {
    body: { ... };
  }
}
```

### Webpack Issues

To correctly execute lambda's they must be self contained bundles, a common issue when bundled incorrectly is missing modules similar to the error below.

```bash
Error: Cannot find module '/.../path/file'
```

To bundle your files correctly ensure that `module.exports.handler` is exposed for each handler file and that you're using individual entires within webpack.

```js
module.exports = {
  target: "node",
  entry: {
    foo: "./src/ts/handlers/foo.ts",
    bar: "./src/ts/handlers/bar.ts",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

If you're starting a new project or not currently bundling, the easiest solution would be to use [netlify/netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda) and it's `build` command.

If you've got a pre-existing webpack config I'd suggest using a webpack helper library such as [8eecf0d2/webpack-netlify-lambda-plugin](https://github.com/8eecf0d2/webpack-netlify-lambda-plugin).
